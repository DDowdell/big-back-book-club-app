### Paperback, Hardback, As Long As Its A **BIG BACK**!

This is a **Book Club App** created for those of us who love to get lost in our reads. Let your imagination take you out of this world and into the world of the Author of your choosing. Head to our *Community* page to get a list of submitted books by all of our users for inspiration. If you see a book you love or have questions about feel free to leave a *comment* or *suggest* that book to be next month's current focus. Doesn't matter the *genre*, style or adventure.. ***let's read together***!
